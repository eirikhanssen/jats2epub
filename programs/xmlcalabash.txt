Install info for Windows users

XMLCalabash is an XProc processor that is required for jats2epub to operate.
XMLCalabash is distributed as a java .jar archive and therefore requires a java runtime environment to run

If you open cmd.exe (from the start menu > run), type java, and this command is recognized, you should be good to go.
If this command is unrecognized, then you need to install a java runtime environment, and the java executable also needs to 
be in the path variable.

QUICK INSTALL for Windows users:

xmlcalabash can be downloaded from: http://xmlcalabash.com/download/

The latest version can be downloaded here: 
https://github.com/ndw/xmlcalabash1/releases/latest

1) Download the zip-archive and put in this folder (jats2epub/programs). 
At time of writing this is xmlcalabash-1.1.9-96.zip, but any later version should be good.

2) Extract this folder.

3) Rename the extracted folder simply to xmlcalabash (stripping away the version part)

4) Rename the jar-file simply to xmlcalabash.jar (also stripping away the version part)

5) Do not reaname any of the other files :)

The reason for this renaming is that the calabash.bat script located in the jats2epub\bin folder will then find the jarfile.
And then the calabash command used by jats2epub will be working.

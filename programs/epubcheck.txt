epubcheck is required in order to validate and pack epub archives
epubcheck is distributed as a java .jar archive and therefore requires a java runtime environment to run

epubcheck can be downloaded from:
https://github.com/idpf/epubcheck

Download link: https://github.com/IDPF/epubcheck/releases/download/v4.0.0/epubcheck-4.0.0.zip

Windows users: Please unzip to this folder and rename the folder epubcheck-4.0.0 (or later version) to epubcheck.

Unix/Gnu/Linux/MacOSX users: please unzip to /usr/local/ or for instance ~/bin/programs
Put shellscript called epubcheck in /usr/bin or ~/bin with the following contents (modify paths as needed):

If you have root acces, unzip epubcheck to /usr/local/programs/ and put a script called epubcheck in /usr/local/bin with these two lines:

#!/bin/sh
java -jar /usr/local/programs/epubcheck/epubcheck.jar "$@"


If you don't have root access, unzip to ~/bin/programs and put a script called epubcheck in ~/bin/ with these two lines:

#!/bin/sh
java -jar ~/bin/programs/epubcheck/epubcheck.jar "$@"

Note that for this to work, you need to either rename the folder "epubcheck-4.0.0" (or later version) to "epubcheck" (without quotes), 
Or you can also make a symlink called epubcheck that points to this folder:
ln -s epubcheck-4.0.0 epubcheck

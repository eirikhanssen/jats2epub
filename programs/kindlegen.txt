Amazon kindlegen is used to convert epub to mobi for use on kindle devices.

Because of licencing restrictions, I can't include Amazon kindlegen in this package.
You can however, download it yourself legally and for free from amazon.

If you wish to automatically create .mobi format for use with kindle devices aswell do the following steps:

Download kindlegen from amazon.
  - Search google: amazon kindlegen
	At time of writing: http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211
    Direct download (at time of writing):
        - Win32: http://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/kindlegen_win32_v2_9.zip
        - Mac OS 10.5 and above i386: http://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/KindleGen_Mac_i386_v2_9.zip
        - Gnu/Linux 2.6 i386: http://kindlegen.s3.amazonaws.com/kindlegen_linux_2.6_i386_v2_9.tar.gz

Install for Windows users:
  1) download kindlegen_win32_v2_9.zip (or any later version) to this folder (jats2epub\programs)
  2) extract the downloaded zip archive this folder (jats2epub\programs)
  3) rename this new folder simply to kindlegen (stripping away the version part)
  4) kindlegen.exe should then be located in jats2epub\programs\kindlegen\kindlegen.exe 
  (then it will be found by the kindlegen.bat file used by jats2epub script)

Install for Unix, Gnu/Linux and MacOSX users: 
    put kindlegen in a folder in path, or create a symlink to it there:
    Some popular suggestions:
	
    Have root access - make system available in /usr/local:
	1) Extract the kindlegen archive to /usr/local/
	2) Make symlink to kindlegen executable from /usr/local/bin: sudo ln -s full/path/to/kindlegen-executable /usr/local/bin/kindlegen

    No root access - you can install somewhere in your home directory: 
	1) suggestion: extract the kindlegen archive to ~/bin/programs/
	2) create symlink from your home directory's bin (~/bin) to kindlegen executable: ln -s ~/bin/programs/kindlegen/kindlegen ~/bin/kindlegen
    
	Notes:
	1) For newbies: ~/ is your home folder, such as /home/username or /Users/username
	2) You might have to do some folder renaming or sym linking to make this work, and make sure the path is correct for your system.
	3) For no root access, this also assumes that the folder ~/bin is in PATH, i.e. it will show up if you type:
	   echo $PATH
	   if unsure on how to do this, do a google search on adding folder to path

Now when you run jats2epub, a .mobi file of the article will also be created

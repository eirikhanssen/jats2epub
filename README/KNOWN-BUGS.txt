Known Limitations and bugs

Windows - problems running kindlegen:
Sometimes when using a windows PC in a managed environment such as at work, it might not be possible to run kindlegen.exe because
of restriction policies enforced by the administrators. Then mobi-conversion might not be possible.

This problem has not been reported on Unix, Gnu/Linux and MacOSX.

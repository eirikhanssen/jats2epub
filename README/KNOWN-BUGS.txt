Known Limitations and bugs

Windows:
if the path name leading to the source-xml-file given on the commandline contains backslashes,
the script will fail.

The solution is:
a) run jats2epub from the same folder as the input xml-file or
b) use a forward slash in the path to the input xml-file

Note that if you use two parameters, one for a folder to be copied, you have to use backslashes in the path of the folder to be added.

Example that should have worked, but fails in windows:

in jats2epub folder:

jats2epub source-xml\saks.xml
jats2epub source-xml\spehar.xml source-xml\spehar

Temporary workaround
 - change the backslash in the path to the input xml-filename to a forward slash:

jats2epub source-xml/saks.xml
jats2epub source-xml/spehar.xml source-xml\spehar

This problem is not present in OS that use forward slash such as Unix, Gnu/Linux and MacOSX.

Windows - problems running kindlegen:
Sometimes when using a windows PC in a managed environment such as at work, it might not be possible to run kindlegen.exe because
of restriction policies enforced by the administrators. Then mobi-conversion might not be possible.

Again, this problem has not been reported on Unix, Gnu/Linux and MacOSX.

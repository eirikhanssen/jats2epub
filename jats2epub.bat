rem	Overview:
rem	
rem	This is a windows batch script that can be used to generate .epub, .html, .mobi 
rem	(and in a later version also .pdf output) from NISO JATS tagged .xml input
rem	This script relies on the XProc pipeline jats2epub.xpl to do the xml
rem	transformation work. This script takes care of all the steps that couldn't 
rem	be implemented in the XProc pipeline jats2epub.xpl alone.
